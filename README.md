# Fire_Detection_using_NodeMCU
IoT-based Flame Detection system
* This Project was created using a NodeMCU and Blynk IoT.
 Whenever the flame is detected by the flame sensor, it sends a digital signal which in turn turns the buzzer and the red LED on, while sending a signal in your Blynk web and mobile dashboards

 Components used
 Flame Sensor
 NodeMCU
 Breadboard
 Male-to-male jumper wires
 2 LEDs - red and green
 5V buzzer
 2 resistors of 180ohms
